To facilitate the management of the window and drawing context, Draw: Mark I was
the first iteration of the Draw component.

\section{Purpose}

The Draw module has to achieve and manage several different tasks.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Window creation and deletion.
    \item OpenGL context creation and deletion.
    \item Rendering objects.
    \item Main window interaction loop.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve window creation and deletion, GLFW is used. This ensures reliability
as GLFW is a well-tested and established library for window and context
creation. To manage the context, a generated version of glad is used.
